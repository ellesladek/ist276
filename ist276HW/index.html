		<h2>What is Melee?</h2>
		<p>Super Smash Bros. Melee was a Nintendo game released for the GameCube on November 21, 2001. 
		Its gameplay differs from traditional fighting games in that the aim is to increase your opponent's damage percentage and knock them off the stage instead of just depleting their health bar.
		Melee was well-received and is the GameCube's top-selling game, selling about 7.09 million copies worldwide as of December 31, 2009. 
		In North America, it sold 250,000 copies within nine days of its release.</p>
		<p>Despite its age and existing sequels, many people still enjoy playing Melee over other games.</p>
		<p id = "emphasis">Why is this?</p>
		<p>Well, I would argue that it has to do with the game's competitive scene and mythologization of some of its top players.</p>
